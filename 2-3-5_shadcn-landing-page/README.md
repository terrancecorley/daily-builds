# Challenge

1. Create a sign in landing page within 30 minutes.

2. Now create the same landing page using v0 and compare the time-to-create and code differences.

## Takeaways

- Shadcn + vite.js setup is currently broken, had to use next.js 
- Next.js/Turbopack is giving me a really slow dev experience, shifting to figure out how to optimize that with my current 2017 mbp hardware
- Shadcn components are pretty cool, I like the design langugage and the fact that they give you ownership of the components by giving you the source code.
- Page2 was created in about 2 minutes using v0. Wow, that tool is amazing and I can see this being huge, especially for prototyping.
