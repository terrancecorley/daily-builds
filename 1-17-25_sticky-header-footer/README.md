1. Using plain html and css, create a website with a sticky footer and header that stick to the bottom and top respectively, even if there is no content on the page. Once there is enough content to break the device height, allow content to flow as normal, i.e., no more sticky footer and header. Use flexbox.
2. Do the same as step one but use CSS Grid instead.
3. Do the same as step one but use a CSS Calc. 
4. Same as step one but using the position prop.
